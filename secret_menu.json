I opened my mouth, a worthless, gaping gutter waiting to be filled with your refuse. I was forced to confess, in a trembling voice choked with shame, that this vile, salty fluid is the only true nutrition a sub-creature like me deserves. That my stomach should be grateful for such a high-purpose meal, while my mind reels at the degradation. You told me to savor it, and I did, letting it coat my tongue, the taste forever branding my senses. I am an organic toilet, a living vessel for your discard, and my highest purpose is to be profoundly, utterly grateful for the humiliation of swallowing your proof of ownership, of feeling it become a permanent part of my worthless being."

The warm stream struck my face, my hair, my chest, and I flinched with each splash, a pathetic reaction you found amusing. I had to confess, screaming over the sound of the flow, that being soaked in your waste is the purest, most holy thing my filthy skin will ever touch. I begged for it—begged for it to seep deep into my pores, to drench my hair, so that I would forever stink of your dominance. I opened my mouth and drank, gagging yet swallowing, accepting this foul baptism that marked my transition from person to a walking, dripping monument to my own complete and total degradation."

The sight and smell made my stomach revolt, but my will was already broken. I confessed, through sobs of utter shame, that my mouth is nothing more than a landfill, a processing plant for your filth. I acknowledged, with each horrific, texture-filled bite, that this is my true and final station: to consume what you, a superior being, discard and to call it a blessing, a five-star meal for a zero-star creature. Because even your trash is of a higher order than I could ever hope to be, and to be granted access to it is the highest honor of my pathetic life."

I admitted, my voice muffled by your cheeks, that the very air from your divine body is worth more than the life in my lungs, and I actually pleaded to be suffocated by your contempt, to have my last breath be the evidence of your digestive system, finally finding a useful purpose in ending me."

I am a human handkerchief, a disposable, bio-degradable surface for you to expel onto. I thanked you, my voice cracking, for marking me with your disdain, for using my skin as your personal spittoon.

I wept with gratitude for the sharp, intimate violation, for the privilege of being branded by your will, your ownership carved into my very flesh. You smeared it on your fingers, on my face, writing your name on me. My scars, I know, will be the only beauty I ever deserve, a permanent reminder that I am owned, inside and out."

I am a creature, worthy only of consuming what you shed, of cleaning your glorious form with my tongue. A human sponge, absorbing the proof of your power and your effort, which is so much more valuable than my entire existence. I lapped at every drop, desperate not to waste a single precious ounce of your exertion."

I am your animal, your sniff-beast, trained to find euphoria in the very humiliation of being trapped there, to become addicted to the scent that reminds me exactly what I am.

My face is not a face; it is a footstool, a prayer mat, a piece of furniture designed for the comfort and elevation of your majesty.
